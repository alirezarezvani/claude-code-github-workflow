  "body": "## Summary\n\nImplement complete monorepo structure with React (Vite) frontend and Express backend, configured for parallel development and coordinated builds.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Root Configuration\n- Added pnpm-workspace.yaml defining client/ and server/ workspaces\n- Created root package.json with parallel dev/build/test scripts\n- Configured concurrently for running both servers\n\n### Client (React + Vite)\n- Initialized Vite project with React 18 and TypeScript\n- Configured ESLint with React and TypeScript plugins\n- Setup Jest with React Testing Library\n- Added Vite proxy for /api routes → backend\n- Responsive CSS with mobile-first design\n\n### Server (Express + TypeScript)\n- Created Express server with TypeScript\n- Configured CORS for frontend origin (localhost:5173)\n- Implemented in-memory BookStore with sample data\n- Setup Jest with Supertest for API testing\n- Added health check endpoint\n\n## Type of Change\n\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n\n## Testing\n\n### Client Testing\n- [x] App component renders correctly\n- [x] Loading state displays during fetch\n- [x] API integration works with mock\n- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors\n- [x] ESLint passes with no warnings\n\n### Server Testing\n- [x] Health check endpoint responds\n- [x] CORS configured correctly\n- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors\n- [x] ESLint passes with no warnings\n\n### Integration Testing\n- [x] Client can connect to server via Vite proxy\n- [x] Both servers start in parallel with pnpm dev\n- [x] Quality checks pass for both workspaces\n- [x] Build succeeds for both client and server\n\n## Fullstack Testing\n\n- [x] pnpm install from root installs both workspaces\n- [x] pnpm dev starts both client (5173) and server (3001)\n- [x] pnpm build compiles both successfully\n- [x] pnpm lint passes for both workspaces\n- [x] pnpm type-check validates TypeScript in both\n- [x] Client → Server communication works (CORS + proxy)\n- [x] Monorepo structure follows best practices\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] Code follows project style guidelines\n- [x] Self-review of code completed\n- [x] Changes generate no new warnings\n- [x] Added tests that prove the fix is effective or feature works\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally\n- [x] Fullstack considerations addressed (client ↔ server integration)\n- [x] Both workspaces have proper .gitignore\n- [x] README.md updated with setup instructions\n\n## Related Issues\n\nCloses #1\n\n---\n\n_Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)_\n\n_Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>_",
